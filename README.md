# HAR Project

The project aims to solve the problem of Human Activity Recognition, from the raw time series data obtained from 30 subjects(people).

The dataset is taken from UCI Machine Learning repository. 

Data is in 2 forms- One is preprocessed by human experts and it is feature engineered. We have done EDA on this data and then compared the performance of various ML models .

Another is raw signal data from sensors. We have applied deep Learning models like LSTM on that data.
